**Introduction:**
This document provides a detailed explanation of the task assigned during the Codtech IT Solutions internship program. The task involves writing, to Create an interactive story where the player makes choices that shape the narrative. BY useing variables, conditional statements, and loopsto construct the branching paths and outcomes. This documentation will cover the implementation details, rationale behind the code structure, and insights into the programming techniques utilized. Additionally, it will include information about the intern, Pravallika Kosanam, and assigned ID, COD4196.
**Intern Information**
Name: Pravallika Kosanam
Intern ID: COD4196
**Task Description**
The task assigned to Pravallika Kosanam during the CodTech IT Solutions internship program is to write a Python program that is a Text-Based Adventure Game.
**Implementation:**
The implementation of the task involves utilizing python programming language to create a structured approach where functions are utilized to handle different stages of the game, offering players meaningful choices and immersive storytelling. The game design encourages exploration, strategic decision-making, and multiple playthroughs to experience different outcomes. Below is the code implementation:
'''python
import time

def introduction():
    print("Welcome to Lost in the Forest!")
    print("You find yourself in the middle of a dense forest.")
    print("Your goal is to find your way out safely.\n")

def choose_path():
    print("Which path will you choose?")
    print("1. Follow the river")
    print("2. Venture into the dark cave")
    choice = input("Enter your choice (1 or 2): ")
    return choice

def follow_river():
    print("\nYou decide to follow the river.")
    print("After walking for some time, you spot a bridge.")
    print("Do you want to cross the bridge?")
    bridge_choice = input("Yes or No: ").lower()
    if bridge_choice == "yes":
        print("\nYou successfully cross the bridge and continue your journey.")
        time.sleep(2)
        print("\nAfter crossing the bridge, you find a road in the middle of the dark forest.")
        print("The road has two directions: left and right.")
        road_choice = input("Which direction will you choose? Left or Right: ").lower()
        if road_choice == "left":
            print("\nYou choose to go left and follow the road.")
            print("After walking for a while, you reach a highway.")
            print("\nCongratulations! You have navigated through the dark forest.")
            print("You successfully completed your adventure!")
        elif road_choice == "right":
            print("\nYou choose to go right and encounter a cruel animal in a cave!")
            animal_choice = input("Do you want to kill it or escape? Kill or Escape: ").lower()
            if animal_choice == "kill":
                print("\nYou bravely fight and manage to kill the animal.")
                print("After defeating the animal, you find a path that leads to a nearby village.")
                print("\nCongratulations! You have safely navigated from the dark forest.")
            else:
                print("\nYou try to escape, but the animal catches you.")
                print("Game Over! You've been killed by the animal.")
                print("You can try again or leave.")
        else:
            print("\nInvalid choice. Please enter Left or Right.")
            follow_river()  # Restart the river path
    else:
        print("\nYou decide not to cross the bridge.")
        print("You continue walking along the riverbank.")

def dark_cave():
    print("\nYou bravely enter the dark cave.")
    print("It's pitch black inside.")
    print("You can barely see anything.")
    time.sleep(2)
    print("\nSuddenly, you hear a growling noise.")
    print("Do you want to proceed forward or retreat?")
    cave_choice = input("Proceed or Retreat: ").lower()
    if cave_choice == "proceed":
        print("\nYou cautiously move forward, but the growling gets louder.")
        print("You realize there's a bear in the cave!")
        print("You run out of the cave as fast as you can!")
    else:
        print("\nYou decide it's too risky and retreat from the cave.")

        follow_river()
    elif choice == "2":

**Code Explanation:**
**Introduction:**
"Lost in the Forest" is an immersive text-based adventure game where players find themselves stranded in a dense forest and must navigate their way to safety. With only two paths available - following the river or venturing into a dark cave - players must make strategic decisions to survive. Each choice they make shapes the narrative, leading to different outcomes and ultimately determining their fate.

**Next:**
Upon choosing to follow the river, players encounter a bridge, presenting them with another decision point. Crossing the bridge leads them to a road in the dark forest, offering two directions - left and right. The choice to go right leads them into a perilous encounter with a dangerous animal lurking in a cave.

**Code Explanation:**
The code is written in Python and utilizes functions to modularize different aspects of the game. The `introduction()` function provides players with an initial overview of the game's objective. The `choose_path()` function prompts players to select their initial path - following the river or venturing into the dark cave. Depending on their choice, they are directed to the corresponding path function - `follow_river()` or `dark_cave()`.

In the extended scenario after crossing the bridge, the `follow_river()` function includes additional logic to handle the encounter with a cruel animal if the player chooses to go right. This involves prompting the player to decide whether to kill the animal or attempt to escape.

**Rationale:**
 the "Lost in the Forest" game code is crafted to provide an immersive, interactive, and enjoyable gaming experience. Its structured design, emphasis on player choice, and attention to narrative detail contribute to its appeal and effectiveness as a text-based adventure game.
**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the task assigned to Pravallika Kosanam during the CodTech IT Solutions internship program is to create Text-Based Adventure Game. The implemented solution successfully accomplishes this task using Python programming principles to create an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience, showcasing the versatility of Python in game development. This documentation provides insights into the implementation details, code explanation, and retionale behide the choosen approach. PravallikaKosanam, with the intern ID COD4196, has effectively completed this task as part of the internship program.
This concludes the documentation for the task "Text-Based Adventure Game" assigned during the CodTech IT Solutions internship program.
